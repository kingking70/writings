    <h1>Consciousness</h1>
    <p>Our consciousness is relevant to our external experience. Our environment shapes us.</p> 
    <p>If a newborn is a piece of plain sheet, then his or her experience gives him or herself character. Babies choose their phonics from the many languages globally based on their surroundings. One could argue their focus state to communication within their community to improve their survival chances possibly due to their innate desire to live. One could also argue that these infants have narrowed their minds as they age.</p>
    <p>Did we choose to be lesser to live?</p>
    <p>If external forces build our character, how do people - from the same environment growing up - make different choices? Is there an internal state that governs us without the influence of the external? If we make different choices due to different interpretations, when were these interpretations evoked?</p>
    <p>Would questions of the consciousness help us build the first Artificial General Intelligence?</p>
